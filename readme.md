**FFLUNet** is a novel, lightweight U-Net variant that incorporates multi-view feature fusion modules to enhance segmentation accuracy while reducing computational overhead. This model is designed for efficient and effective medical image segmentation and has been evaluated on multiple benchmark datasets.

## ‚ú® Highlights

- üî¨ Designed for 3D medical image segmentation
- üß† Enhanced feature fusion between encoder-decoder paths
- üöÄ Lightweight architecture with competitive performance
- üìâ Fewer parameters (1.45M) and faster inference than standard U-Net and nnU-Net

## üß† Model Architecture

The FFLUNet architecture enhances the classical U-Net by integrating feature fusion blocks that aggregate spatial and semantic information across layers. This fusion is both **progressive and multi-scale**, leading to better context understanding.
